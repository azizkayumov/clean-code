### How Would You Build A City?

Could you manage all the details yourself? Probably not. Even managing an existing city is too much for one person. Cities work because they have teams of people 
who manage particular parts of the city, the water systems, power systems, traffic, law enforcement, building codes etc. Some people are responsible for the bigger picture, 
while others focus on the details.      

Cities work since they have evolved into a high level of abstraction that makes it possible for individuals to manage the components effectively, without understading the big picture.      
Software systems are often organized like that too, the clean code helps us achieve this at the lower levels of abstraction.
