### Class Organization
The Java convention: a class should begin with a list of variables: public static constants first, then private static variables, followed by private instance variables. There is seldom a good reason to have a public variable.      
Public functions should follow the list of variables followed by privaye utilities called by a public funtion right after the public function itself. This follows the stepdown rule and helps the class read like a newspaper article.      
Try to keep variables and utility functions `private`, but don't be fanatic about it. Sometimes they can be `protected` so that they can be accessed by a test. The goal should be **testability**, if a test in the same package needs to call a function or access a variable, we'll make them protected or package scope considering a way to maintain privacy. **Loosening encapsulation is always a last resort**.
