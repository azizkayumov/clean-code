### Attitude
It is the programmer's job to defend the code with equal passion as   
managers obsess about the schedule.

### What is Clean code?

It is not the language that makes programs appear simple. It is the programmer that make the language appear simple!

The ratio of **time spent reading vs. writing is well over 10:1**. We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort
to write new code, so *making it easy to read makes it easier to write*.
